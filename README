  GoNetlink aims to provide native bindings (no external libraries) to NetLink for Go.

  It is a child project of GoGo (not released yet), but is growing to be usable in its own right at least
as a reference project on "how to (start) talking to netlink with go".

  All API's are subject to change, and patches are absolutely welcome.

  There's a very good chance there will be issues on non i386/amd64 archs, as they have not been tested
and netlink doesn't always specify byte order.

  Currently working:
  - Enumerating interfaces
  - Modifying flags (Up/down/etc) on interfaces
  - Adding addresses on interfaces

  TODO:
  - The inverse of the above
  - Routing attributes
  - Substantial cleanup of the NLATTR/RTATTR behaviour
  - "Generification" of the netlink process.
